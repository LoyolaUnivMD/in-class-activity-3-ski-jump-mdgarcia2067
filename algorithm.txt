1. Ouput the purpose of the the program using 
2. Ask the user for the type of hill using "What is the hill type?"
3. If hillType == normal
  a. height = 46
  b. pointsPerMeter = 2
  c. par = 90
4. Otherwise
  a. height = 70
  b. pointsPerMeter = 1.8
  c. par = 120
5. Calculate the time in the air using sqrt((2*height)/9.8)
6. Ask for the jumper's speed using "What was the jumper's speed?"
7. Calculate the distance traveled using jumper's speed * time in the air
8. Calculate points earned using 60 + (distance - par) * pointsPerMeter
9. Output " Distance Travelled:(x) Points Earned: (y)"
10.If pointsEarned >= 61
  a. output "Great job for doing better than par!"
11. Otherwise if pointsEarned < 10
  a. output "What happend??"
12. Otherwise
  a. output "Sorry you didn't go very far"
